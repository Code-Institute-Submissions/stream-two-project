# Stream Two Project

### Data Driven Website

This is my final project for Stream Two of my Full Stack Web Development course through [Code Institute](https://www.codeinstitute.net/)

The data I have used is from [Donor Choose](https://www.donorschoose.org/).  After testing the site on various devices I have decided to lower the amount of donations from 25000 to 20000, as the site was taking too long to load.

### The Technologies Used for the Site:

	* HTML
	* CSS
	* JavaScript
	* jQuery
	* Bootstrap
	* Flask
	* Mongo DB
	* D3.js
	* Dc.js
	* Crossfilter.js
	* Queue.js

### Testing

* I have tested the site on browsers such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Microsoft Edge
* I used Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox developer tools to check my code
* I used [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/) to check my code
* With the help of family and friends I tested my site on multiple devices
